                    <p>
                        Outside of my passion for technology, I’m an active runner on my school’s varsity cross country
                        and track teams. Running has been a giant part of my life. It helps me stay focused and
                        disciplined, pushing myself to reach new goals. I was awarded the most improved award from
                        cross-country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my proudest moments was being awarded the Most Improved Award in cross-country. This
                        recognition was a testament to the hard work and dedication I put into my training. It wasn’t
                        just about the physical improvement, but also the mental resilience and perseverance I developed
                        along the way. Running has taught me valuable life lessons about commitment, goal-setting, and
                        the importance of a positive mindset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s an early morning run or a challenging race, I embrace every opportunity to push my
                        limits and grow as an athlete. Running is more than just a sport to me; it’s a passion that
                        fuels my drive and ambition in all areas of my life.
                    </p>

                        In addition to running, I also enjoy playing basketball in my free time. It’s a fun way to stay
                        active, challenge myself physically, and work on my teamwork skills. There's something
                        exhilarating
                        about the fast pace of the game and the strategy involved.

                        When I’m not out running or on the court, I like to unwind by watching movies. I love getting
                        lost
                        in different worlds and stories, whether it's a thrilling action film, a heartwarming drama, or
                        a
                        thought-provoking documentary. Movies are my escape, and they offer a perfect way to relax and
                        recharge.
